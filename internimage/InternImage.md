# InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with

## Abstract

> Different from the recent CNNs that focus on large dense kernels, InternImage takes **deformable convolution as the core operator**, so that our model not only has the **large effective receptive field** required for down-stream tasks such as detection and segmentation, but also has the **adaptive spatial aggregation conditioned by input** and task information

## Ключевые особенности

> While these results suggest that CNNs are inferior to ViTs in the era of massive parameters and data, we argue that **CNN-based foundation models can also achieve comparable or even better performance than ViTs** when equipped with similar operator-/architecture-level designs, scaling-up parameters, and massive data.
